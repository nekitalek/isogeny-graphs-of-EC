# isogeny-graphs-of-EC
investigation and analysis of a graph structure that illustrates the action of isogenies on the set of j-invariants of elliptic curves

Program that performs the construction of graphs of j-invariants of isogenic nonsupersingular elliptic curves for various simple degrees of isogeny and the calculation of the isogeny star. Also program that generates an isogeny graph of supersingular curves.
